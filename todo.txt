# Model inputs
- Add noise to images 
- Change the resolution of the images
- Shift the images

# Model structure
- Change the number of hidden layers
- Identify the bottleneck of the model, whether the CNN or the sequential:
2 experiments: change parameters of CNN and leave LSTM as is, then change LSTM and leave CNN as is

# Performance
- Substitute the FasterCNN algorithm with YoloV7
- Search for a dataset that does not have sagittal or frontal views
